# neural-network
I've built a neural network-[class](https://github.com/magnushelliesen/neural-network/blob/main/neural_network/neural_network.py) (from first principles, only using NumPy) with a train/backpropagation method. I've applied it in a [notebook](https://github.com/magnushelliesen/neural-network/blob/main/neural-network.ipynb), and it works really well (it was a lot of tinkering, lemme tell ya)! What did the trick was to switch from batch gradient descent to stochastic gradient descent. This is really cool! Next: apply it to real data, like pictures or handwritten numbers or something.
